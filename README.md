## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized deployment, optional)

### Quick Start (Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshit27gupta/Algo_project.git
   cd Algo_project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   cd server && npm install
   cd ../Compiler && npm install
   cd ../client && npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   - Create your env file with the following details
   - | Server                | Client                | Compiler      | 
     |-----------------------|-----------------------|---------------|
     | PORT                  | VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID | PORT          |
     | MONGODB_URI           | VITE_API_URL          | 688ms         | 
     | JWT_SECRET            |                       |               | 
     | JWT_EXPIRE            |                       |               | 
     | NODE_ENV              |                       |               | 
     | GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID      |                       |               | 
     | GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET  |                       |               |
     | GEMINI_API_KEY        |                       |               |
     | COMPILER_URL          |                       |               |


4. **Start services (development mode):**
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
   ```
   Or run each service manually for local development.

5. **Access the app:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000/api/v1](http://localhost:5000/api/v1)
   - Compiler Service: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

### Production Deployment

- Use `docker-compose.yml` for production-ready deployment.
- Adjust rate limits and environment variables as needed.
- Consider adding Redis for caching and session management.
- Set up monitoring and load balancing for high-availability.
