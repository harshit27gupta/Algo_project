# Algo_project

## üìö Overview

**Algo_project** is a full-stack online judge platform designed for competitive programming and coding practice. It allows users to register, solve algorithmic problems, submit code in multiple languages (C, C++, Java), and receive instant feedback. The system is built for high concurrency, robust performance, and a smooth user experience, making it suitable for both individual learning and large-scale contests.

## üöÄ Deployment

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (v18+)
- **MongoDB** (local or cloud)
- **Docker & Docker Compose** (for containerized deployment, optional)

### Quick Start (Development)

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/harshit27gupta/Algo_project.git
   cd Algo_project
   ```

2. **Install all dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the example environment files and update them with your configuration:
   ```bash
   cp server/.env.example server/.env
   cp client/.env.example client/.env
   cp Compiler/.env.example Compiler/.env
   ```
   
   **Required environment variables:**
   - **Server**: `MONGODB_URI`, `JWT_SECRET`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GEMINI_API_KEY`
   - **Client**: `VITE_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `VITE_API_URL`
   - **Compiler**: `PORT` (optional, defaults to 8000)

4. **Start services (development mode):**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Using Docker (recommended)
   npm run dev
   
   # Option 2: Manual start (requires MongoDB running locally)
   # Terminal 1 - Server
   cd server && npm run server
   
   # Terminal 2 - Compiler Service  
   cd Compiler && npm run compiler
   
   # Terminal 3 - Client
   cd client && npm run dev
   ```

5. **Access the application:**
   - Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) (development) or [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (production)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:5000/api/v1](http://localhost:5000/api/v1)
   - Compiler Service: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
   - Health Checks: 
     - Server: [http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health](http://localhost:5000/api/v1/health)
     - Compiler: [http://localhost:8000/health](http://localhost:8000/health)

### Development Commands

From the root directory:
- `npm run install:all` - Install dependencies for all services
- `npm run dev` - Start all services with Docker
- `npm run lint` - Run linting for client and server
- `npm run lint:fix` - Automatically fix linting issues

### Production Deployment

- Use `docker-compose.yml` for production-ready deployment.
- Adjust rate limits and environment variables as needed.
- Consider adding Redis for caching and session management.
- Set up monitoring and load balancing for high-availability.

## üß™ Testing & Performance

The system has been thoroughly tested to ensure it can handle high loads and provide a reliable experience.

### Load Testing

- **Tools Used:** Artillery (professional-grade load testing)
- **Concurrent Users:** 150+ supported
- **Request Rate:** 30 requests/second sustained
- **Compiler Service:** 100+ concurrent compilations (C, C++, Java)

### Key Results

| Metric                | Before         | After         | Improvement         |
|-----------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Success Rate          | 53%           | 100%          | +47%                |
| Max Response Time     | 8,288ms       | 688ms         | 12x faster          |
| Mean Response Time    | 2,154ms       | 141ms         | 15x faster          |
| 95th Percentile       | 6,703ms       | 290ms         | 23x faster          |
| Rate Limit Errors     | 131           | 0             | 100% reduction      |
| Failed Requests       | 70            | 0             | 100% reduction      |

- **Compiler Service:** 100% success rate, average response time 2.41s, all languages supported, no timeouts or crashes under load.

### Error Handling & User Experience

- Error messages are clear and mapped to the correct lines in user code.
- Warnings are treated as errors for better feedback.
- Error lines are highlighted in the code editor.
- Java submissions are fully isolated to prevent file conflicts.
