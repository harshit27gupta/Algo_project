# Trie-based Autocomplete Debugging and Solution

## Problem Faced

- **Autocomplete for Java keywords and user-defined classes (e.g., `Pair`) was not working as expected.**
- Priority Java collections and keywords were not always suggested at the top.
- User-defined classes (like `Pair`) were not suggested after being declared in the code.
- Sometimes, suggestions appeared in lowercase (e.g., `pair` instead of `Pair`).

## Debugging Process

1. **Checked which editor component was actually rendered.**
   - Found that `CodeEditor` (Monaco-based) was used, not `AutocompleteEditor`.
2. **Verified Trie learning logic.**
   - Added debug logs to check if Trie was learning from code.
   - Discovered that learning was not triggered in the correct component.
3. **Ensured learning from code in the correct place.**
   - Moved learning logic and logs to `CodeEditor.jsx`.
   - Confirmed learning was triggered on code/language changes.
4. **Investigated casing issue.**
   - Found that the Trie was lowercasing all words for storage, but suggestions sometimes used the lowercased version.
   - Fixed the Trie logic to always update and use the original casing (`originalWord`) for suggestions.
5. **Expanded Java collections.**
   - Added more important Java collections to both the keywords list and the priority set for better autocomplete relevance.

## Solution Implemented

- **Learning logic** is now in `CodeEditor.jsx`, ensuring user-defined classes and identifiers are learned from the code as soon as it loads or changes.
- **Trie logic** was fixed to always use the original casing for suggestions, so `Pair` is suggested instead of `pair`.
- **Priority and keywords lists** were expanded to include more Java collections for better competitive programming support.
- **Debug logs** were added throughout the process to verify learning and suggestion behavior.

## Result

- Autocomplete now suggests both Java keywords and user-defined classes (like `Pair`) with correct casing and priority.
- The system is easier to debug and extend in the future.
